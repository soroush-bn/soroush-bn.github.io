                <h2 class="subtitle">Computer Science Master| Machine Learning Engineer/ Software Developer</h2>
                <p class="bio">
                    Since 2016 that I went to the programming competition for the first time, untill today which is 10 years later, I have been always passionate about learning about computer science world and it was never enough. 
                    What I love about this field is that you see a problem first and you think its impossible to solve it, but then you divide it into small pieces and you solve each piece like a puzzle and after many hours of work, debugging and sometimes frustration, you finally 
                    solve the problem and this is so rewarding for me. I had this motive back of my mind when I was doing my bachelors and when I was working in industry and that was the reason I persued my masters in computer science. 
                    Now that I'm graduating, I am sure that I can use my engineering skills to solve real world problems in different domains.

                    <p>
                        My current research focuses on generating highly accurate synthetic data for EMG and IMU signals. 
                        By leveraging state-of-the-art architectures like VQ-VAEs and decoder-only transformers, 
                        this work aims to significantly improve the training and responsiveness of prosthetic control systems.
